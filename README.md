# Cognifyz Internship Tasks
This repository contains all the tasks I have completed during my internship with Cognifyz. Each folder corresponds to a specific task and contains the following:

## Level 1 
1. **Task 1**:  Data Exploration and Preprocessing
   ->Explore the dataset and identify the number of rows and columns.
   ->Check for missing values in each column and handle them accordingly.
   ->Perform data type conversion if necessary. Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identify any class imbalances.
2. **Task 2**: Descriptive Analysis
   -Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
   -Explore the distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code, " "City, " and "Cuisines."
   -Identify the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.
3. **Task 3**: Geospatial Analysis
   -Visualize the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude information.
   -Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries. Determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating.
   
 ## Level 2
1. **Task 1**:  Table Booking and Online Delivery
   -Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.
   -Compare the average ratings of restaurants with table booking and those without.
   -Analyze the availability of online delivery among restaurants with different price ranges.
3. **Task 2**: Price Range Analysis
   -Determine the most common price range among all the restaurants.
   -Calculate the average rating for each price range.
   -Identify the color that represents the highest average rating among different price ranges.
5. **Task 3**: Feature Engineering
   -Extract additional features from the existing columns, such as the length of the restaurant name or address.
   -Create new features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.

 ## Level 3
1. **Task 1**: Predictive Modeling
   -Build a regression model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on available features.
   -Split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
   -Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest) and compare their performance.
1. **Task 2**: Customer Preference Analysis
   -Analyze the relationship between the type of cuisine and the restaurant's rating.
   -Identify the most popular cuisines among customers based on the number of votes.
   -Determine if there are any specific cuisines that tend to receive higher ratings.
5. **Task 3**: Data Visualization
   -Create visualizations to represent the distribution of ratings using different charts (histogram, bar plot, etc.).
   -Compare the average ratings of different cuisines or cities using appropriate visualizations.
   -Visualize the relationship between various features and the target variable to gain insights.
